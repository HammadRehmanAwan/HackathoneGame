A simple yet addictive 2D game that demonstrates blockchain integration for recording high scores on the Solana network.

Overview:
"Solana Highscore Dodger" is a classic 2D arcade-style game where players control a character to avoid an endless barrage of falling obstacles. The objective is to survive as long as possible, accumulating points as time passes. What makes this game unique is its integration with the Solana blockchain, allowing players to submit their hard-earned high scores directly to the Solana devnet as transaction memos.

Features:

Engaging 2D Gameplay: Navigate your player left and right to dodge falling blocks in a fast-paced, increasing difficulty environment.

Local High Score Tracking: Your highest score is saved locally in your browser, encouraging you to beat your personal best.

Phantom Wallet Integration: Seamlessly connect your Phantom wallet to enable on-chain score submission.

Solana Devnet Submission: Submit your game scores to the Solana devnet using transaction memos, providing a verifiable record of your achievement on the blockchain.

Responsive Design: The game canvas and interface adapt to various screen sizes, offering a consistent experience on desktop and mobile browsers.

Why Blockchain for High Scores?
While this game uses a simple transaction memo for demonstration, storing high scores on a blockchain like Solana offers:

Transparency: All submitted scores are publicly verifiable on an immutable ledger.

Decentralization: No single entity controls the leaderboard; it's maintained by the network.

Proof of Achievement: Players have cryptographic proof of their high scores, which can't be tampered with.

Future Possibilities: Opens doors for tokenized rewards, decentralized leaderboards, and other Web3 gaming mechanics.

How to Play:

Open index.html (or your saved HTML file) directly in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) where your Phantom Wallet extension is installed and unlocked.

Click "Connect Phantom Wallet" and approve the connection.

Ensure you have some SOL on the Solana Devnet for transaction fees (you can get test SOL from a devnet faucet if needed).

Click "Start Game" to begin.

Use the Left and Right Arrow Keys (or 'A' and 'D') to move your player.

Avoid the falling obstacles for as long as you can!

Once the game ends, if your wallet is connected, click "Submit Highscore" to record your score on the Solana blockchain. A link to Solscan will appear for verification.
